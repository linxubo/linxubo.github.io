# Open positions

ã€€**Our lab is primarily a computational biology/bioinformatic group that develops and uses a wide range of genomic, bioinformatic, and statistical methods, but when desired, we would also do wet-lab experiments. We would work closely with hospitals to carry out a series of studies on (but not limited to) mosaic mutations, our goal is to explore and understand the origin of somatic mutations as well as the role of mosaic mutations in varied human diseases. We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!**
