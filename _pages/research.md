# Research

  Our group mainly focus on the fundamental researches of **Membrane Biophysics** and **Nano-Bio Interface** as well as their potential applications in **Nanomedicine**. Currently, our researches use molecular simulations, and expand gradually to include molecular cell biology experiments.
  
**1. Screen/Design Drug Candidates with Molecular Docking and Protein-Protein Docking**.
Our interests here include drug repropursing, the modernization of Chinese Medicine, and AI-based tool development.

**2. Reveal the Melocular Mechanisms for the Structure and Dynamics of Cell Membrane**. 
Intra-leaflet and inter-leaflet couplings related to nanoscale dynamic membrane domains ("lipid rafts"), as well as their biological significance will be our research focus.

**3. Probe the Detailed Interactions between Nanoparticle-Drug Conjugate/Lipid Nanobubbles and Cell Membrane**. 
In this part, we aim to regulate the dynamics of membrane domains and membrane proteins in a controllable manner with Nanoparticle-Drug Conjugate/Lipid Nanobubbles.

**Computational Resources @ Our Group**:
7 workstations with 172 Intel Xeon CPU cores + purchased computer time @ National Supercomputing Center.
In this part, we aim to regulate the dynamics of membrane domains and membrane proteins in a controllable manner with Nanoparticle-Drug Conjugate/Lipid Nanobubbles.
