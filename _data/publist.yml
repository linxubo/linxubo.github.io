  description: In this work, we performed multiple μs-scale Martini coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to reveal the interaction details between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and full-length human ACE2. Besides, the key coarse-grained systems were backmapped into the corresponding all-atom system for further quantifications. Our results indicated that the plier structure in two ends of binding interface plays a key role in the binding process of SARS-CoV-2 RBD with ACE2. Furthermore, we also found that when there is no B0AT1 in the simulation system, the N-terminus of ACE2 is more likely to approach the cell membrane, which has a strong correlation with the subsequent fusion of the virus and with the cell membrane.

- title: "Applications of Molecular Dynamics Simulations in Drug Discovery"
  image: Book2022.jpg
  description: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is a powerful tool to obtain the kinetic information and calculate thermodynamic properties for the protein-drug interactions. In this chapter, we briefly introduce the applications of MD simulations in the preparation of high-throughput virtual screening including generating conformational ensemble, optimizing the structures of small molecules, and identifying the drug binding sites on the target protein. In the process of high-throughput virtual screening, docking calculations based on MD force fields, coarse-grained MD simulations as well as end-point binding free energy calculations such as MM/PBSA or MM/GBSA can be applied to achieve the balance between the accuracy and the efficiency. In the postprocessing stage of high-throughput virtual screening, the top hits can be further reevaluated and reranked by either long MD simulations with enhanced sampling methods or various more precise binding free energy calculation approaches. At last, the application of MD simulation in drug permeability is also discussed.

- title: "Designing amphiphilic Janus nanoparticles with tunable lipid raft affinity via molecular dynamics simulation"
  image: BiomaterialsScience2021.jpg
  description: Our μs-scale free coarse-grained MD simulations as well as umbrella sampling free energy calculations indicated that the hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic surface ligands not only determined the lateral membrane partitioning thermodynamics of Janus NPs in phase-separated lipid membranes, but also the difficulty in their insertion into different membrane domains of the lipid membrane. These two factors jointly regulated the lipid raft affinity of Janus NPs. Meanwhile, the hydrophilicity of the hydrophilic surface ligands could affect the insertion ability of Janus NPs. Besides, the ultra-small size could ensure the membrane-bound behavior of Janus NPs without disrupting the overall structure and phase separation kinetics of the lipid membrane. These results may provide valuable insights into the design of functional NPs targeting and controllably regulating lipid rafts.

- title: "Surface Ligand Rigidity Modulates Lipid Raft Affinity of Ultra-small Hydrophobic Nanoparticles: Insights from Molecular Dynamics Simulations"
  image: Nanoscale2021.jpg
  description: A series of μs-scale coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations and umbrella sampling free energy calculations were performed to investigate the role of surface ligand rigidity of ultra-small hydrophobicNPs in their raft affinity. Our results indicated that the preferred localization of NPs can be tuned by adjusting their surface ligand rigidity. Generally, rigid NPs tended to target the raft domain, while soft NPs preferred the interface of the raft and non-raft domains. The free energy analysis further indicated that the surface ligand rigidity of NPs can enhance their targeting to lipid raft domains. Besides, we found that these ultra-small NPs had no significant effects on the phase separation of the lipid membrane although they might cause some local interference to surrounding lipids.

Drug development is always one of the main missions in Medicinal Chemistry. In the past several decades, nanoscience and nanotechnology have made great progress in facilitating drug development. Especially, nanoparticle-drug conjugates, which integrate both the advantages of nanoparticles and drugs, have shown great potential in treating a series of diseases including cancers. In this thematic issue, we focus on the current advances in computational and experimental approaches in nanoparticle-drug conjugates.

- title: "Transmembrane Potential of Physiologically Relevant Model Membranes: Effects of Membrane Asymmetry"
  image: JCP2020.jpg
  description: In this work, we performed a series of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of symmetric model membranes of various lipid compositions and cation contents to evaluate the relationship between membrane asymmetry and Vm. The results suggest that, for an asymmetric POPC-POPC/POPS bilayer in the presence of NaCl, the presence of the monovalent anionic lipid POPS in the inner leaflet polarizes the membrane (ΔVm < 0). Intriguingly, replacing a third of the POPS lipids by the polyvalent anionic signaling lipid PIP2 counteracts this effect, resulting in a smaller negative membrane potential. We also found that replacing Na+ ions in the inner region by K+ depolarizes the membrane (ΔVm > 0).
