- title: "Evaluate Interactions between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and Full-length ACE2 with Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Simulations"
  image: JCIM202202.png
  description: In this work, we performed multiple μs-scale Martini coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to reveal the interaction details between SARS-CoV-2 RBD and full-length human ACE2. Besides, the key coarse-grained systems were backmapped into the corresponding all-atom system for further quantifications. Our results indicated that the plier structure in two ends of binding interface plays a key role in the binding process of SARS-CoV-2 RBD with ACE2. Furthermore, we also found that when there is no B0AT1 in the simulation system, the N-terminus of ACE2 is more likely to approach the cell membrane, which has a strong correlation with the subsequent fusion of the virus and with the cell membrane.

- title: "Designing amphiphilic Janus nanoparticles with tunable lipid raft affinity via molecular dynamics simulation"
  image: BiomaterialsScience2021.jpg
  description: Our μs-scale free coarse-grained MD simulations as well as umbrella sampling free energy calculations indicated that the hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic surface ligands not only determined the lateral membrane partitioning thermodynamics of Janus NPs in phase-separated lipid membranes, but also the difficulty in their insertion into different membrane domains of the lipid membrane. These two factors jointly regulated the lipid raft affinity of Janus NPs.

- title: "Optimization of hydrophobic nanoparticles to better target lipid rafts with molecular dynamics simulations"
  image: Nanoscale2020.jpg
  description: In this work, we designed a ligand-modified spherical nanoparticle with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, which can be encapsulated into the hydrophobic region of the lipid membrane and specifically target either raft or non-raft membrane domains. The preferred localization of the nanoparticle can be tuned by adjusting ligand hydrophobicity, length and density.
