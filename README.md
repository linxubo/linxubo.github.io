# NanoBioMembrane Lab Website

Our website is based on the open source templates designed and shared by the labs of [D. Allan Drummond](http://www.allanlab.org/aboutwebsite.html) and [Yanmei Dou](https://yanmeidoulab.github.io/). We greatly thank for Allan and Yanmei for allowing reuse of their codebase. 

The website is deployed using GitHub Pages and the source code is available on GitHub. Please feel free to reuse this code (making sure to cite the Drummond lab and Sanders lab as the original sources of the lab website template).
